<h1>Chicken</h1>

<p> The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus),
    originally native to Southeast Asia. 
</p>




<p>
As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more than 50 billion birds produced annually for
consumption. Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat and egg production,
respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are social animals with complex
vocalizations and behaviors, and feature in folklore, religion, and literature across many societies. Their economic
importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry.

<h2>Nomenclature</h2>

<p>Chicken can mean a chick, and this was historically the meaning of the word chicken,[16] as in William Shakespeare's
play Macbeth, where Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam".[17] The usage is preserved in
placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[18] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts,
chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.[19]</p>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the
wings are short.[20] Wild junglefowl can fly, whereas domestic chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow
them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[20] Newly hatched chicks of
both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties however grow much faster; by
day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of the same
age.[22]
